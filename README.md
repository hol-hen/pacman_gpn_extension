## What needs done?
- Animate pacman to open and close mouth
- Move pacman with arrow keys
- Ghost move randomishly towards pacman
- Ensure ghosts and pacman can't go through walls
- Let pacman eat dots, and add to score
- Hearts taken if Pacman caught by ghost
- Gameover for zero hearts
- Add cherries and coins as extensions
